Introduction

Genders is a simple concept that has been extended to address configuration
management issues that arise on MPP clusters[1].  The basic concept is that a
genders file containing a list of node names and their attributes is
replicated on each node in a cluster.  By representing the configuration of
an MPP in this file, scripts and rdist Distfiles that might otherwise
contain hard-coded node lists, can be generalized to work with different
configurations of the same cluster, and even with multiple clusters.

The framework has proven to be useful on clusters ranging in size from the
ASCI Blue-Pacific SST system at 1464 nodes, to collections of two or three
workstations.  

Basic Operation

This section describes the formats of the genders file and the nodeattr 
command.  The genders file, briefly described in the introduction, contains
a list of node names, and for each node, a list of attributes.  The genders
file is typically found in /etc (on Linux when installed from the genders
RPM) or /admin/etc (on other systems).

Genders Format

Each line of the genders file has the following format:

     nodename attr[=value],attr[=value],attr[=value],...

The nodename is the shortened[2] hostname of a node and must be unique in
the genders file.  This is followed by any number of spaces or tabs, and then
the comma-separated list of attributes, each of which can optionally have a
value.  There must be no spaces embedded in the attribute list and there is
no provision for continuation lines.  Commas and equal characters are special
and cannot appear in attribute names or their values.  Comments are prefixed 
with the hash chracter (#) and can appear anywhere in the file.  The active
genders file is typically found at /etc/genders or /admin/etc/genders.

Here is a rather undeveloped genders file from a small 8-node linux cluster:

     slc0 elanid=8,passwdhost,nqsmgr
     slc1 elanid=9,nqscompute
     slc2 elanid=10,nqscompute
     slc3 elanid=11,nqscompute
     slc4 elanid=12,nqscompute
     slc5 elanid=13,nqscompute
     slc6 elanid=14,nqscompute
     slc7 elanid=15,nqscompute

Nodeattr Usage

A program called nodeattr is used to query data in the genders file.  Because
the genders file is replicated on all nodes in a cluster, this query is a
local operation, not dependent on the network.  Nodeattr is invoked as
follows:

     nodeattr [-f genders] [-q | -c | -n | -s] [-r] attr[=val]
     nodeattr [-f genders] [-v] [node] attr[=val]
     nodeattr [-f genders] -l [node]
     nodeattr [-f genders] --check

The -f option specifies a genders file path other than the default.

The -q, -c, -n, or -s options followed by an attribute name cause a list of
nodes having the specified attribute to be printed on stdout, formatted
according to the option specified: -q is hostrange, -c is comma-separated, 
-n is newline separated, and -s is space separated.  

If none of the formatting options are specified, nodeattr returns a zero
value if the local node has the specified attribute, else nonzero.  The -v
option causes any value associated with the attribute to go to stdout.  If a
node name is specified before the attribute, it is queried instead of the
local node.

The -l option is used to generate a list of attributes for a particular
node.  If the node is not specified, a unique attributes appearing in the
genders file.

Nodeattr can usually be found in /usr/bin (Linux RPM) or /admin/scripts 
(other systems).

Example: Rc Script

The nodeattr command can enable a single script to behave differently
depending on the role or gender of the node it is executing on, simplifying
configuration management of the MPP.  For example, all nodes in an MPP
could have the same rc.local file:

     #!/bin/sh
     if nodeattr raid; then
             initialize_raid
     fi
     if nodeattr login;
             then sshd
     fi
     ...

If the node has "raid" in its attribute list, it would execute
initialize_raid; if it had "login" in its attribute list, it would start the
secure shell daemon.  This technique is simpler and less prone to failure
than adding code to test for "clues" to a nodes function, such as the
existence of a RAID device in /dev or a different set of installed products
on a login node.  Further, changing the role of a node does not require
a laborious audit of scripts; one simply changes the genders file and
all genders-enabled scripts change their behavior.

Attribute values might be used to store node configuration information such
as a node's default IP route.  For example, the node may have an attribute:

     iprouter=big-rtr.llnl.gov

and rc script could extract this value and pass it to the route command:

     route add net default `nodeattr -v iprouter`

Example: Host Lists

Host lists are commonly needed on MPP's to set up parallel jobs or to run
system administration commands on particular sets of nodes.  In the following
example, nodeattr generates a newline-separated list of nodes with the login
attribute to pass to the fping parallel ping command:

     fping `nodeattr -c login`

Batch system configurations typically need lists of nodes that belong to
batch queues.  These might be generated by assigning nodes belonging to a
particular queue an attribute in the genders file and then using nodeattr to
generate the batch configuration.  For example, an NQS manager host might get
its configuration as follows, assuming the nqsmgr and nqscompute attributes
are appropriately assigned in the genders file:

     #!/bin/sh

     #
     # Configure queues on the nqsmgr node.
     #
     if nodeattr nqsmgr; then

             # All nodes with the nqscompute attribute will be B queue destinations.
             # Make a comma-separated list of B@host destinations.
             for host in `nodeattr -n nqscompute`; do
                     CPU_QUEUES=${CPU_QUEUES}B@${host},
             done
             CPU_QUEUES=`echo $CPU_QUEUES|sed 's/,$//'`

             echo Adding manager queues
             qmgr << EOT
                     set log_file /var/spool/nqs/log
                     set shell_strategy fixed = (/bin/sh)
                     set default destination_retry wait 1
                     create pipe_queue X priority = 10 \
                         server = (/usr/lib/nqs/pipeclient) \
                         destination = ($CPU_QUEUES)
                     run_limit = 1
                     set default batch_request queue X
                     enable queue X
                     start queue X
                     exit
     EOT
     fi

     #
     # Configure queues on the nqscompute nodes.
     #
     if nodeattr nqscompute; then
             echo Adding compute queues
             qmgr << EOT2
                     set log_file /var/spool/nqs/log
                     set shell_strategy fixed = (/bin/sh)
                     create batch_queue A priority=10
                     create pipe_queue B priority=10 \
                         server=(/usr/lib/nqs/pipeclient)  \
                         destination=(A) run_limit=1
                     enable queue A
                     enable queue B
                     start queue A
                     start queue B
                     exit
     EOT2
     fi
     exit 0

Programming with Genders

Three different APIs have been developed that allow programmers to
programmatically parse the genders file.  "libgenders" is a C API which
can be linked by including genders.h and linking the library libgenders.
"Libgenders" is a Perl extensions interface directly to the C API (with
minor changes for the inherent differences between C and Perl). "Genders"
is another Perl API, but offers a more traditional Perl API than
"Libgenders."  The reader can learn more about these libraries by reading
the manpages libgenders(3), Libgenders(3), and Genders(3).

Example: nqs_mknmap

The following script uses the Genders library to get a list of all nodes
in the cluster.  It then adds them to the NMAP database used by NQS:

     #!/usr/bin/perl
     #

     # $Source: /g/g0/achu/temp/genders-cvsbackup-full/genders/TUTORIAL,v $
     #

     use Genders;

     $prog = "nqs_mknmap";
     $path_nmapmgr = "/usr/bin/nmapmgr";
     $path_nmapdir = "/etc/nmap";

     if (opendir(DIR, $path_nmapdir)) {
             foreach $file (grep(!/^\.\.?$/, readdir(DIR))) {
                     unlink("$path_nmapdir/$file");
             }
             closedir(DIR);
     }
     if (! -d $path_nmapdir) {
             mkdir($path_nmapdir, 0755);
     }

     if (open(PIPE, "|$path_nmapmgr")) {
             printf PIPE ("create\n");
             $i = 0;
             $obj = Genders->new();   
             foreach $node ($obj->getnodes()) {
                     printf PIPE ("add mid %d %s\n", $i, $node);
                     $i++;
             }
             printf PIPE ("exit\n");
             close(PIPE);
     }  else {
             printf STDERR ("%s: could not exec $path_nmap_mgr\n", $prog);
             exit(1);
     }
     exit(0);

[1] Here a cluster is a collection of nodes that are administered as a unit,
where each node runs its own UNIX operating system image.

[2] This should be the hostname as reported by the hostname -s command.
Names for other network interfaces on the same node do not appear in the
genders file.
