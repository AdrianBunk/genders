Genders is a static file cluster configuration database.  This package
includes a number of libraries useful for parsing a genders database
in C and Perl programs.  It includes:

* libgenders    
  - A C library which can be linked with -lgenders.  See
    libgenders(3).

* Libgenders.pm
  - A Perl module developed with Perl Extensions that accesses
    the C library.  Perl extensions is limited and provides
    a very strange Perl API.  It is therefore recommended most users
    use Genders.pm.  See Libgenders(3).

* Genders.pm
  - A Perl module that interfaces with Libgenders.pm, hiding away
    the yuckiness of Libgenders.pm.  See Genders(3).

* nodeattr
  - A command that parses and outputs information from a genders 
    database.  See nodeattr(1).

* gendlib.pl
  - Genders Perl API for backwards compatability.  For the most 
    part used exclusively on site at Lawrence Livermore National 
    Laboratories.  Probably of no use to outside clusters.  See
    gendlib(3).
