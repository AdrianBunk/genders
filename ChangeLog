Changes while living on linux:

	Removed herolib.pl stuff temporarily.  It needs to be merged back in.

	If not PSSP, assume /usr/bin/rdist is USC rdist, and default rsh is OK.

	Only include sdrlib.pl in gendlib.pl.   Genders::to_altnames and
	Genders::to_gendnames now provide conversion between genders hostnames 
	and alternate hostnames.  On the SP, this is accomplished using the
	sdrlib functions which access the initial_hostname and 
	reliable_hostname SDR attributes.  On other systems, "altname" 
	genders attribute holds the alternate hostname (gendlib.pl, dist2).

	Added "-c <cluster>" option.  This tells dist2 to use 
	/admin/etc/genders.<cluster> instead of the default.  Handy for 
	rdisting to a foreign cluster, e.g. one that is behind a bastion 
	host that can mount /var/dist (but inside can't mount it) (dist2).

	Added "-o <options>" option.  List of options are passed
	through to the real rdist, e.g. "dist2 -o verify" (dist2).

	Don't look for /var/dist/VAR_DIST_IS_MOUNTED if "-f Distfile" option
	specified (dist2).

	If -n option specified, implicitly set -v (dist2).

	GNU fileutils 4.0p include install program with -C option.
	This is the main reason for having the 'inst' utility, therefore it
	should now be considered deprecated.  Update your rdist Makefiles
	to use GNU install -C.

	Removed jmd stuff (hostlist.pl).

vers0.1 Jim Garlick <garlick@llnl.gov>
	
	Added genders.spec, DISCLAIMER.
	Removed dist_passwd.

	Path changes:
	/admin/bin/perl		-> /usr/bin/perl
	/admin/etc/genders 	-> /etc/genders
	/admin/etc/clusters	-> /etc/clusters
	/admin/lib/gendlib.pl 	-> /usr/lib/genders/gendlib.pl
	/admin/scripts/dist2	-> /usr/bin/dist2
	/var/dist/bootstrap	-> /usr/bin/dist_bootstrap

	Now that we have an RPM, dist_bootstrap only has to copy out
	/etc/genders and /etc/clusters.

	Makefile only attempts to build inst.
