	* Added updatefstab and updateservice scripts.
	* tagged genders-0-2-2

2001-07-14 garlick

<date unknown> garlick
	* Path changes: 
	  /admin/bin/per	-> /usr/bin/perl
	  /admin/etc/genders 	-> /etc/genders
	  /admin/etc/clusters	-> /etc/clusters
	  /admin/lib/gendlib.pl	-> /usr/lib/genders/gendlib.pl
	  /admin/scripts/dist2	-> /usr/bin/dist2
	  /var/dist/bootstrap	-> /usr/bin/dist_bootstrap
	* Now that we have an RPM, dist_bootstrap only has to copy out
	  /etc/genders and /etc/clusters.
	* Makefile only attempts to build inst.
	* Remove "require 5.003" lines; instead require perl in spec file.
	* Removed herolib.pl stuff temporarily.  It needs to be merged back in.
	* If not PSSP, assume /usr/bin/rdist is USC rdist, and default rsh 
	  is OK.
	* Only include sdrlib.pl in gendlib.pl.  Genders::to_altnames and
	  Genders::to_gendnames now provide conversion between genders 
	  hostnames and alternate hostnames.  On the SP, this is accomplished 
	  using the sdrlib functions which access the initial_hostname and 
	  reliable_hostname SDR attributes.  On other systems, "altname" 
	  genders attribute holds the alternate hostname (gendlib.pl, dist2).
	* Added "-c <cluster>" option.  This tells dist2 to use 
	  /admin/etc/genders.<cluster> instead of the default.  Handy for 
	  rdisting to a foreign cluster, e.g. one that is behind a bastion 
	  host that can mount /var/dist (but inside can't mount it) (dist2).
	* Added "-o <options>" option.  List of options are passed
	  through to the real rdist, e.g. "dist2 -o verify" (dist2).
	* Don't look for /var/dist/VAR_DIST_IS_MOUNTED if "-f Distfile" option
	  specified (dist2).
	* If -n option specified, implicitly set -v (dist2).
	* GNU fileutils 4.0p include install program with -C option.
	  This is the main reason for having the 'inst' utility, therefore it
	  should now be considered deprecated.  Update your rdist Makefiles
	  to use GNU install -C.
	* Removed jmd stuff (hostlist.pl).
