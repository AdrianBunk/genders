This file describes changes in recent versions of genders. It
primarily documents those changes that are of interest to users
and admins.

Changes in genders-1.5-1
========================
 -- Added nodeattr --diff to compare genders databases.
 -- Added nodeattr -X option.
 -- AIX Support.

Changes in genders-1.4-1
===========================
 -- Increased genders loading and search speed. 
 -- Added genders querying ability.
 -- Removed maximum attribute and value limitations.

Changes in genders-1.3-1
===========================
 -- Added fixes for the following corner cases:
    - duplicate attributes
    - whitespace between attributes and inline comments
    - trailing whitespace
    - no nodes listed
    - no attributes listed
 -- Added hostrange nodename support to specify ranges of hosts
    rather than a single node on each line of the genders file
 -- Nodes can now be specified on multiple lines
 -- Re-ordered error return code priority within many API functions.
    For example, when an array of length 0 is specified,
    GENDERS_ERR_OVERFLOW may be returned instead of GENDERS_ERR_PARAMETERS.
 
Changes in genders-1.2-1
===========================
 -- Removed implicit "all" attribute from compat/gendlib.pl.  If
    future use of the "all" attribute is required, it must be listed
    as an attribute of every node in the genders database.  See
    the genders.sample file for an example.
 -- Removed use of the /etc/clusters file from compat/gendlib.pl.  If
    future use of a cluster name is required, it must be listed as the
    value of the "cluster" attribute for each node in the genders
    database.  See the genders.sample file for an example.
 -- Removed -r and -C options from nodeattr.  If future use of the
    cluster name is required, the value of the "cluster" attribute can
    be retrieved using the -v option.

Changes in genders-1.2-pre1
===========================
 -- Hostlist code in hostlist.pl (genders-compat package only)
    can now expand ranges without a prefix (.e.g "[0-10]" and "0-10")
    as well as compress back to this same form.
 -- started NEWS file.
