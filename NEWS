This file describes changes in recent versions of genders. It
primarily documents those changes that are of interest to users
and admins.

Changes in genders-1.3-1
===========================
 -- Added additional parsing code that handles situations in which
    a genders database line has trailing whitespace.
 -- Added fix to handle nodes without any attributes.
 -- Improved performance of genders database parsing.
 
Changes in genders-1.2-1
===========================
 -- Removed implicit "all" attribute from compat/gendlib.pl.  If
    future use of the "all" attribute is required, it must be listed
    as an attribute of every node in the genders database.  See
    the genders.sample file for an example.
 -- Removed use of the /etc/clusters file from compat/gendlib.pl.  If
    future use of a cluster name is required, it must be listed as the
    value of the "cluster" attribute for each node in the genders
    database.  See the genders.sample file for an example.
 -- Removed -r and -C options from nodeattr.  If future use of the
    cluster name is required, the value of the "cluster" attribute can
    be retrieved using the -v option.

Changes in genders-1.2-pre1
===========================
 -- Hostlist code in hostlist.pl (genders-compat package only)
    can now expand ranges without a prefix (.e.g "[0-10]" and "0-10")
    as well as compress back to this same form.
 -- started NEWS file.
