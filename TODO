- Allow attributes or attributes=value checking for each line of the genders
  file that works with nodeattr --check option
  o i.e. nodeattr --check all
  o possibly add functionality to genders_parse()  
- Genders comparison of two files.  Via nodeattr??  
  - Via new function in genders?\
- Somehow make distcheck work with perlxs.  Or is this even possible b/c
  uninstall is not supported by perlxs, sigh :-(
- Allow attribute values to be overwritten instead of causing errors
  by some flag option of some sort.
  o i.e. 
    #! overwrite-flag
    a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i   all,attr=val,printer=foo
    g,h,i               printer=bar
- Rework to allow multiple hashed attrval mappings?
- Have genders_getnodes() return nodes in sorted order?
- List nodes in genders database with incremental ability 
  mcr[1-50/2] would be mcr1,3,5,7,...
  mcr[1-50/3] would be mcr1,4,7,10,...
  - think about format, do through hostlist.[ch]??
- Cleanup malloc-buffering in list/hash since its not necessary for genders.
- genders_query allow really odd-ball parsing like
  - "attr-&-|"  
- For multilib, repackage everything
  - genders
  - genders-lib
  - genders-perl
    - must be based on current perl install
  - genders-compat
- Add perl requirement to spec
- and perl versioning
- and linking to new libgenders?
