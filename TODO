- I really really really need a test suite of some sort.
- Allow attributes or attributes=value checking for each line of the genders
  file that works with nodeattr --check option
  o i.e. nodeattr --check all
  o possibly add functionality to genders_parse()  
- Genders comparison of two files.  Via nodeattr??  
  - Via new function in genders?\
- Somehow make distcheck work with perlxs.  Or is this even possible b/c
  uninstall is not supported by perlxs, sigh :-(
- Allow attribute values to be overwritten instead of causing errors
  by some flag option of some sort.
  o i.e. 
    #! overwrite-flag
    a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i   all,attr=val,printer=foo
    g,h,i               printer=bar
- Rework to allow multiple hashed attrval mappings?
- Have genders_getnodes() return nodes in sorted order?
- Clean things up in general, library state is currently in 
  a state with multiple hacks placed on top of other hacks.
