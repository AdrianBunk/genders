- Genders comparison of two files.  Via nodeattr?? --diff options?? 
  - Via new function in genders?\
  - but how would the output look like? sigh ...
- Allow attribute values to be overwritten instead of causing errors
  by some flag option of some sort.
  o i.e. 
    #! overwrite-flag
    a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i   all,attr=val,printer=foo
    g,h,i               printer=bar
- Rework to allow multiple hashed attrval mappings?
- Have genders_getnodes() return nodes in sorted order?
- List nodes in genders database with incremental ability 
  mcr[1-50/2] would be mcr1,3,5,7,...
  mcr[1-50/3] would be mcr1,4,7,10,...
  - think about format, do through hostlist.[ch]??
- For multilib, repackage everything
  - genders
  - genders-lib
  - genders-perl
    - must be based on current perl install
  - genders-compat
