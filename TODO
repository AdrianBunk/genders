- Re-work code to reduce memory footprint
  - Decrease Hash multiplier?
  - Remove MAXHOSTNAMELEN buffers?
- Only export genders symbols.
- Have libgenders have lib dependency of pthread.
  - Or do not compile with pthreads?
- Allow attributes or attributes=value checking for each line of the genders
  file that works with nodeattr --check option
  o i.e. nodeattr --check all
  o possibly add functionality to genders_parse()  
- Genders "regex" parsing.  i.e.
  genders_getnodes("attr1+attr2,attr3");
- Genders comparison of two files.  Via nodeattr??
